#Claiming a Refund Owed

If a campaign has failed, WeiFund allows users to claim a refund. Custom campaigns are not currently required to provide a refund method and such refunds would therefore need to be handled by the campaign owners in those cases. If you have contributed to a campaign that has failed, you may receive a refund by following the process below.

1. Select the campaign from which you would like a refund
2. Check if the refund functionality is present
3. If it is, click “Claim Refund Owed”
4. Select the refund settings, if any
5. Then click, “Review Refund Claim”
6. Review your refund information
7. Then click, “Claim Refund Owed”
8. If successful, you should receive a refund receipt. If there was an error, you will receive an error message
