##Setting Up A Wallet
WeiFund has specifically made the decision to not provide a wallet at this time. While this may change in the future, WeiFund will require you to either install an Ethereum wallet locally on your computer or install an Ethereum powered browser extension such as MetaMask as your wallet. Provided below are a set of instructions to install and run Ethereum wallets.

###Mist

2. Download the Mist client for your computer (i.e. mac, linux, windows)
3. Open the Mist client
4. Wait for the client to sync with the blockchain (this may take several hours)
5. Setup a wallet password
6. To purchase a small amount of ether, you can use the Coinbase Buy Widget that is integrated into Mist. If you want to buy more or are in a country that is not supported by Coinbase, see the Getting Ether section.
