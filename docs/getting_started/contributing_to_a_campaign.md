8. Receive a contribution receipt
9. Print out and save the contribution receipt as a PDF

##Setting Up A Wallet
WeiFund has specifically made the decision to not provide a wallet in both the client and portal at this time. While this may change in the future, WeiFund will require you to either install an Ethereum wallet locally on your computer or install an Ethereum powered browser extension such as: MetaMask. Provided below are a set of instructions to install and run Ethereum wallets to run the WeiFund platform.

##Mist
1. Goto [Mist](https://github.com/ethereum/mist)
2. Download the Mist client for your computer (i.e. mac, linux, windows)
3. Open the Mist client
4. Setup a wallet password
5. Select the livenet (not the “testnet”) option
6. Wait for the client to sync with the blockchain (this may take several hours)
7. Goto the URL bar, and type in either the address to the [WeiFund portal](www.weifund-basic.surge.sh) or the [WeiFund client](ipfs.com/gateway/weifundHASH).
8. Then follow the “Contributing to a Campaign” instructions

##MetaMask
1. Open either Chrome or Firefox browsers
2. If on Chrome goto [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) click "Get Chrome Plugin"
3. Install the MetaMask app
4. Client on the orange MetaMask fox that has now appeared at the top right hand side of the browser
5. Begin the wallet setup process (i.e. select a password, notate your password seed etc)
6. Then goto the [WeiFund portal](www.weifund-basic.surge.sh) or the [WeiFund client](ipfs.com/gateway/weifundHASH).
7. Then follow the “Contributing to a Campaign” instructions
