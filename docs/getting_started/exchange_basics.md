Exchanges usually work by exchanging one currency or token for another. This process is called trading. In order to trade conventional currencies like USD or CAD, exchanges require that you provide some basic identification. This process usually takes about 3-5 business days and usually involves you sending in a scan of your identity (i.e. passport or driver's license) and providing some basic bank information. Many exchanges allow you to debit money from your bank account, to your exchange account.Once you have deposited some conventional currency into your exchange account you may begin the process of trading your conventional currencies for Ether (ETH).

A trade usually involves you setting the selling or buying price of either Ether or some currency and the amount you would like to sell. For example: “Selling 500 Canadian dollars for Ether priced at 15 Canadian Dollars per Ether.” Once you have completed trading of your conventional currency to Ether, you can withdraw the currency to your Ethereum wallet. If you do not have a wallet, please visit “Setting up an Ethereum wallet” for more details.
