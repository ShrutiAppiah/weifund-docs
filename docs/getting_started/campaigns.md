In this section, we highlight the way users of WeiFund can create a campaign, contribute to a campaign, claim a refund if the campaign was not successful and payout the amount raised to the beneficiary of the campaign.

#Creating a Campaign
WeiFund provides campaign smart contract templates, referred to in short as just Campaign Templates. These templates make it easy for many people to deploy a campaign on WeiFund as doing so requires only a few clicks. WeiFund also enables third parties to integrate their own custom campaign code.

###Campaign templates
WeiFund continues to develop its reusable smart contract templates known as Campaign Templates for anyone to use. Campaign Templates enable anyone to create a WeiFund crowdfunding smart contract system that is built to the Weifund Campaign Specification. Since the re-use of components in Campaign Templates strengthen those system over time, most users will be better off using them than building custom campaign code from scratch.

**Available Templates**

Currently there is only one Campaign Template, the ‘Standard Campaign’. But many more are being developed.  

**Benefits of Campaign Templates**

- Thoroughly tested, secure smart contracts
- Proven crowdfunding logic
- Open sourced, allowing feature submissions by the community.
- Complete with standard crowdfunding features like token dispersal and contribution receipts
- Seamlessly integrated with a growing number of other Ethereum services
- A few clicks to deploy


##Custom Campaign
While WeiFund recommends that you use our Campaign Templates, you may also create and integrate custom campaign contracts. To integrate your custom contracts, read the details of the [Campaign Specification](http://weifund.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specifications/overview/). Of course, since WeiFund’s Campaign Templates are open source, it is possible to extend those contracts themselves to create your custom campaign code.

**The benefits**

- New or custom features
