WeiFund allows you to payout campaigns to the beneficiaries. However many payout functions are access restricted, which means only the owner of the beneficiary account may withdraw the campaign funds. Other times, the beneficiary payout function is not access restricted and so anyone could payout the campaign funds raised to the beneficiary account. If a campaign is successful, select it on WeiFund and see if the “Payout To Beneficiary” button is available. If so, click on the green button. Then select the payout settings and click “Review My Payout”. Review the payout information, then click “Make Campaign Payout”. Once this is complete, you will either receive an error message or a campaign receipt. If you receive a payout receipt, this means the payout should be successful.
