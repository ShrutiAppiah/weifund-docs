WeiFund requires that you have some amount of Ether to either start or contribute to campaigns. Both the Mist and MetaMask Ethereum wallets have the Coinbase Buy Widget installed that lets you buy small amounts of ether in many countries.

For some people in certain jurisdictions or for those wanting to acquire a larger amount of ether, you may want to use one of these exchanges:

- [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/)
- [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/)
- [BitStamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/)
- [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/)
- [BTCChina](https://www.btcc.com/)
