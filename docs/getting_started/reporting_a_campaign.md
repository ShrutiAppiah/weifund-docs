If you believe a campaign to be in any way fraudulent, improperly constructed, or suspicious in any way, you should report the campaign to the WeiFund community immediately. You may do so by starting a topic or post on the WeiFund reddit or forum [provide links].


Please notate the topic as:

*“Report Claim [Campaign Name] #[Campaign ID] [either “fraudulent”, “invalid”, “suspicious”]”*
