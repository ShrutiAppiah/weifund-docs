# Welcome to Weifund

WeiFund is an open platform for crowdfunding campaigns. You can launch a campaign using one of Weifund’s secure contract templates that we develop, or you can integrate your own campaign - the details of that integration are outlined below in this documentation. Weifund’s is built on Ethereum.

With a strong focus on security and smart contract best practices, Weifund makes it easy to launch a safe campaign that works in the Weifund user interfaces. Vetting systems provide users with assessments of campaign readiness, allowing communities to confidently fund selected campaigns and their post-campaign business logic. WeiFund provides both Weifund.io, our campaign portal, and clients interact with campaigns that are accessible from IPFS [Portal IPFS hash?].

##The Portal
The Portal is a fully functional web-dApp where visitors can see and contribute to curated campaign registries. Campaign details are listed with a description of their funding goal and expiry, and importantly allows users to contribute to the campaigns that they feel are important. As platform functionality grows and we continue to roll out features on the portal, we plan to develop infrastructure for different community-based filters.

##Clients
WeiFund clients are downloadable user interfaces through which users can interact with all features of the platform, including creating and contributing to campaigns. Clients will be available through decentralized file-storage systems like IPFS and require the use of a running Ethereum client.

##Testnet & Livenet
The WeiFund platform will support both the Ethereum (ETH) livenet and testnet. Features will emerge first on the testnet and then once validated may be released to production on the mainnet. The WeiFund portal and client can detect which network you are on and set the contract addresses accordingly. However, please ensure you are on the desired network before proceeding with creating or interacting with any WeiFund contract or listed campaign. We recommend you use and experiment with WeiFund on the Etheruem testnet, before publishing your campaign to the livenet on WeiFund. We recommend you to create an experimental campaign on the testnet with a campaign template, and then see if all the details you have selected are correct before moving to the livenet.
