The WeiFund platform has several specifications it requires campaigns to follow in order to be listed on the WeiFund platform. Campaigns must either follow the WeiFund campaign contract specification or provide an interface contract that follows this specification. Campaigns that choose to register additional information through the campaign data registry must also follow the WeiFund campaign data specification. Campaigns will not be listed on the client or portal if they do not follow the campaign contract interface specification. Additional data will not be listed or shown if campaigns do not follow the campaign data specification.
