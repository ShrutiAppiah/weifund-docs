#Overview

The WeiFund Campaign Specifications define how campaign smart contract systems and campaign data (such as video links and text descriptions) interact with the WeiFund platform. It is composed of two main parts: the Contract Interface and the Data Specification. The WeiFund registries are used to list these specifications and make them available to WeiFund.

The Contract Interface defines the functions and attributes that must be available on a smart contract system for it to be considered a valid campaign system. The Contract Interfaceâ€™s implementation provides data to WeiFund to adjust its user interface according to required input fields.


The Data Specifications allow campaigns to register additional information that can be displayed for users on WeiFund.

In this section we will review each part of the Campaign Specifications, and then provide details on registering them with the WeiFund registries.
