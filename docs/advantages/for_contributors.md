WeiFund has many advantages for contributors. Here are a few.

##Incredible User-Experience
The WeiFund platform provides a unified system for crowdfunding campaigns on Ethereum and does so by providing the user with listing, vetting, contribution and payout functionalities.

##Rich Security Information
WeiFund requires all campaigns to provide as much detail as they can about their campaign security. This includes providing their campaign contract source code, vetting information and campaign information. This provides contributors with a lot more information to make an informed decision about the campaigns they want to contribute to.

##Community Oversight
Once a campaign is listed, the WeiFund community can begin to analyze and discuss the campaign in question. This allows for a tremendous amount of community oversight. All this information is then available through reddit and other platforms for contributors to follow and discuss.
