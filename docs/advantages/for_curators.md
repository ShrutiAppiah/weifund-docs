WeiFund allows anyone to become a project vettor. This means anyone can create their own list of campaigns. Curators are allowed to select campaigns, however, once a curator selects a campaign they cannot deselect a campaign. This is on purpose so that curators are held accountable for campaigns they have selected that have either failed or were not successful.

##Become a Curator Extraordinaire
WeiFund allows anyone to become a curator, by selecting campaigns they want on their curated list. Remember, if you do become a curator, choose wisely.

##Selection and Listing Systems
The platform allows you to easily become a curator by selecting campaigns for your curated list. If contributors would like to view your list, they can do so by selecting curators they know and trust, which will then list the campaigns that curator believes to be successful.

##Provide Curator Information
Curator information allows contributors to see why you have chosen the campaigns on your list, who you or your company is, and why contributors should want to view your list of campaigns.
