The WeiFund campaign interface contract contains all essential method requirements. We recommend that your main campaign contract inherit this contract interface and follow it tightly. If you choose not to do this, then you must provide a side interface contract and register that alongside your campaign in the WeiFund Campaign Registry. Please ensure you have deployed and registered your campaign on the WeiFund Testnet portal or client and that you have gone through the contribution and refund flows successfully before registering your campaign on the WeiFund standard registry.

```

function version() constant returns(string) {}

/// @notice the campaign name
/// @return contractual metadata which specifies the campaign name as a string
