The WeiFund platform both uses and recommends a set of contract registries and templates. WeiFUnd offers a standard campaign template, a campaign registry to register campaigns and their interface contracts (if any), a campaign data registry to register additional campaign data (such as descriptions, website links, images and videos) and a standard interface contract which campaigns must follow in order to be listed.

##Design Philosophy and Practices
The WeiFund platform attempts to build contracts in an atomic manner. It's current construction features several simple registries, meeting a very specific concern, and a standard campaign template to help people start campaigns on WeiFund. In essence we design contracts in general accordance with the ConsenSys “Smart Contract Best Practices” document [provide link] and the UNIX coding design philosophy [provide link]
