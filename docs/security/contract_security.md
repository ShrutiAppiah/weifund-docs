The WeiFund platform allows anyone to register virtually any contract with an owner property. This means contracts can be registered which look like campaigns but do not function like campaigns. This also means campaigns may be registered with invalid or improper functionality. This is why we recommend you only interact with campaigns that are created with the WeiFund standard campaign factory.
