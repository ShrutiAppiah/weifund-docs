#Smart Contract Vetting

WeiFund has created a contract readiness vetting process for campaigns to follow that allow them to increase their transparency and trustworthiness. The security readiness assessment is the largest component of this process. Campaigns are requested to populate a vetting template with public and permissioned document references that demonstrate the security and general readiness of the smart contract system representing the campaign.

The contract readiness information will be provided (as available) via the WeiFund user interface. The contract readiness data will allow potential contributors to review campaigns based on the type, breadth and quality of readiness testing that has been performed on the campaign smart contract system. Examples of the readiness testing to be conducted may include nominal-path testing, edge-case testing, and security analysis. The security analysis may include security-focused source code reviews with attestors, static analysis specifications and results, run-time test coverage and results, bug bounty specifications, external audit results, and rollout plan specification.

WeiFund platform provides a range of security measures to platform projects, contributors and the broader Ethereum community. This includes contract, procedural, security and curation standards that reduce but do not eliminate invalid, suspicious or dubious campaigns registered on WeiFund. The WeiFund is also designed to defensively thwart known attack vectors.
