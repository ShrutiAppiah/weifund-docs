The WeiFund platform provides a range of security measures to platform projects, contributors and the broader Ethereum community. This includes contract, procedural, security and curation standards that reduce but do not eliminate invalid, suspicious or dubious campaigns registered on WeiFund. The WeiFund client and portal is also designed defensively to attempt to thwart known attack vectors.
