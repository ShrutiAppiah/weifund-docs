The WeiFund organization and platform uses several measures to prevent anti-spoofing on the WeiFund platform. We provide a list of sites currently spoofing the WeiFund portal and platform. This list will be available through the reddit, github and other outlets. We recommend the platform users and projects check this list before using WeiFund. Secondly, the curation systems provided by the WeiFund curation registry, allows platform users to see what trusted third-parties believe to be campaigns they believe are valid. Users should also refer to the campaign's website and alternative document to ensure the end transactions they are making are to the appropriate accounts in question. This means verifying from their wallet, if they are transacting with the appropriate campaign accounts.
